## Pro

- Uses a `Colemak`-like character layout, which is pretty popular.
- Good for `Vim` users, `LHJK` are put together.

- Only a couple of keys move between hands for typists come from `QWERTY`.
- Be much more ergonomic than `QWERTY` (and many other layouts).
- Common key bindings still can be done on the left hand.

- It is optimized for both English and Chinese (Pinyin).
- Punctuation is optimized.
