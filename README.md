## Pro

- Uses a `Colemak`-like character layout, which is pretty popular.
- Good for `Vim` users, `LHJK` are put together in a row.
- For game players, `WASD` are still together.
- Very few lateral alphabetic motion to break typists' threads of thinking.
- Only a couple of keys move between hands for typists come from `QWERTY`.
- Be much more ergonomic than `QWERTY` (and many other layouts).
- Common key bindings still can be done on the left hand.
- Be friendly to both matrix keyboard and standard keyboard.
- In addition to optimizing English, Chinese Pinyin is also taken into account.
- Positions of the most popular punctuation marks are optimized.
- It is `free and open source software` (`FOSS`).

## About
- `CODE` keyboard layout is forked from [`Colemak-DH`](http://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/).
